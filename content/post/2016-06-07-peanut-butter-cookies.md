Mmm peanut butter cookies!

###  Recipe

#### Preparation

Preheat the oven to 175C/155C Fan/Gas 4 and line two flat baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Locate your cooling rack for being super prepared.

#### Ingredients

- 75g/2¾oz margarine
- 100g/3½oz golden caster sugar
- 1 large free-range egg
- 100g/3½oz plain flour
- 1 tbsp golden syrup
- 100g/3½oz crunchy peanut butter
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 50g/1¾oz nuts (almonds or peanuts work well)
- Pinch of salt

#### Method

1. Cream together the margarine and the sugar with a wooden spoon until pale.
1. Beat in the egg, a little of the flour (20g), the golden syrup and peanut butter.
1. Stir in the remaining flour and the bicarbonate of soda.
1. Finally stir through the peanuts.
1. Put dessertspoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking trays. Leave plenty of space between them as the cookies will spread out during baking.
1. Bake for 10 minutes, until a pleasing brown colour. Note that they will be quite soft, that's OK.
1. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes on the trays then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
