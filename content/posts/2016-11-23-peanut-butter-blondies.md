Continuing my theme of loving [peanut butter](https://s-boardman.github.io/recipe/peanut-butter-cookies)

##  Recipe

### Preparation

Preheat the oven to 160C/180C/Gas 4. Find and grease your favourite brownie tin (approx 20cm by 20cm). Locate your cooling rack for being super prepared.

### Ingredients

- 200g white chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 50g salted peanuts, chopped (or unsalted if you like)
- 200g peanut butter (good quality stuff which uses sustainable palm oil)
- 150g caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- 100g plain flour (could use a gluten free alternative)
- 1tsp baking powder

### Method

1. Get a pan of water simmering then put the PB, 3/4 of the chocolate (150g), and the sugar into a heat proof bowl and stick it on top of the pan (don't let the bowl touch the water!). Stir gently until the ingredients are combined.
2. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes before adding the eggs in turn, giving a good mix each time to make sure everything's nicely mixed.
3. In a separate bowl sift the flour and baking powder then fold in the mass of peanut butter and melted chocolate.
4. Once this is all mixed together (no visible flour!) pour into your greased tin and stick it in the oven for 25-30 minutes until just about firm in the centre.
5. Leave to cool a few minutes in the tin before transferring to a wire rack.
6. Once completely cool cut and devour at will.
